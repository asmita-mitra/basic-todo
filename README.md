Basic To-Do List App

This is a beginner-level to-do list project I'm building while learning Python.

### Status: In Progress

Right now, the app includes:
- `logic.py` â€“ handles basic task logic

Planned additions:
- GUI using Tkinter
- JSON file support to save tasks
- Better UI and features

I'll keep updating this repo as I build and learn more.
